<h2>An Orphan Named Susan</h2>
<p>Have you ever asked yourself if you have true joy or simply joy based on good circumstances? I hadn't until last summer when I met a young girl named Susan. Her mother died during the <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/photos/harris-then-and-now.pdf?ua=1">Ebola crisis</a> in Sierra Leone and her father is not in communication with her. This is the story of my encounter with her:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="http://www.thedreamhome.net/child-profiles/susan-grace">Susan Grace</a>. As soon as we showed up to the <a href="http://www.thedreamhome.net/">orphanage</a>, she latched onto me and followed me around everywhere. Sitting under the tin roof of the school, shouting to hear each other above the pounding rain, she looked up at me and smiled. It wasn&rsquo;t a fake smile. It was a real smile. And I wondered how she could be smiling after losing her parents and her siblings. After being taken from her home and being sent to an orphanage with <a href="http://www.thedreamhome.net/child-profiles">21 other children</a>. After her birth family became part of a statistic about the Ebola crisis and she was left alone in the world. Yet here she was grinning up at me while I was wanting to cry out because of the conditions these sweet children were living in. As I was angry that they didn&rsquo;t have a choice where they were born. As I was questioning why I was so privileged. As I was irritated that people take frivolous things for granted in the US. As I was frustrated that I couldn&rsquo;t do more to help than to love on an orphan in Africa. And as I looked down at sweet Susan smiling, I realized that her joy wasn&rsquo;t from her circumstance. It was from Jesus. She took comfort in knowing that Jesus would be her daddy even when her dad on earth wasn't in the pictureon earth and her mom had passed away from a vicious disease. She knew that He had given her a new home with other children she now calls brothers and sisters because He saw her. She could have been a thief out on the streets, fighting to survive, but Jesus had showed up for her and had given her an immense joy even after all the hardships she had gone through as a young child. He had healed her heart after He had walked with her through the valley. That day, I learned that my joy shouldn&rsquo;t come from my circumstances in life because that isn&rsquo;t real joy at all. The only real joy comes from Jesus and that is the joy I strive to have. The joy that Susan, an orphan in Sierra Leone, has.</td>
