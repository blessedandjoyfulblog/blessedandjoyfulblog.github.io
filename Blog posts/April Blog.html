<h2>I Never Dreamed</h2>

    <td>A little less than a year ago, I left home for a month. I was excited to see what Jesus was going to do. What he did was shatter my world. I never dreamed that a year later I would still be crying my heart out over beautiful <a href="http://www.thedreamhome.net/child-profiles">orphans</a>. I never dreamed that a year later I would still be gushing to my friends about the amazing people and experiences I had overseas. I never dreamed that I would still be praying daily for the sick baby I prayed over in Kroo Bay. I never dreamed that I would be homesick for a country I had only been in for 17 short days. I never dreamed how much He could shatter my world in four weeks. And now, sometimes all I want to do is go back to sleeping on the muddy floor of room 205 in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjJIKKm1r4Y">Hedjazi Hotel</a>. Sometimes all I want to do is go walk through Magazine Wharf, among the pigs nad sewage, praying over children, loving on them, and showing them that someone cares. Sometimes all I want to do is cry out in anger at the suffering of the people I encountered. Sometimes I just want to fix it! And it's discouraging to know that I can't. I can't do everything. One quote from the book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kisses-Katie-Story-Relentless-Redemption/dp/1451612095">Kisses from Katie</a></em>, says, &quot;I have learned that I will not change the world. Jesus will do that. I can, however, change the world for one person. So I keep stopping and loving one person at a time. Because this is my call as a Christian.&quot; And this is my desire too. I want to love one person at a time and show Jesus to them. So I will keep on letting Jesus break my heart as I go out to change one person while He changes me.</td>
